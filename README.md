Base Architecture

## Starting Development Server:rocket:

- You need to have `Python` installed in your machine. Run this command `python --version` in your terminal/command prompt. If you get something like `v3.10.4` then you have successfully installed python on your machine.:sparkles:
- Now download the zip file of the repository. Or use `git clone <package-name>`.:sparkles:
- Now open `src>web>modelled-data` directory and extract the modelled-data zip file here.
- Open a terminal in the `src>web` directory or you can simply open the folder inside vscode and open the integrated terminal. Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` this will simply install all the required python modules.:sparkles:
- After the installation is finished run `streamlit run app.py` and wait for couple of seconds for ` You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.` this message to appear on terminal.:sparkles:
- Now open a browser and go to `localhost:8501` and voila!!:fire::fire:

## Model Training

- You need to have `Jupyter Notebook` in your machine.
- Now open a terminal in `src>main` directory and then run `jupyter notebook`.
- Once your jupyter notebook is ready. Open `Machine_Learning_Project.ipynb` file and run all cells.
- voila!!:fire::fire: your modelled data is created and ready to use.
